    Trillions of gallons of water are being wasted every year. The reason? Leaky faucets, sinks, and toilets, faulty showerheads and sprinkler systems. The EPA says that all this adds up to 1 trillion gallons of wasted water each year, in the US alone. How does this happen? Most people don't notice, or they dont care when they see water slowly dripping from their faucet. However, they don't realize how much water is truly being squandered. One leaky sink, dripping one drop of water per minute, do the math, and that adds up to over 34 gallons annually. Add every faulty sink, pipe, sprinkler, and that can add up to a lot every year.
